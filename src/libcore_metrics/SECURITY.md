# Veil's Security HowTo

We appreciate your help in finding bugs and identifying vulnerabilities in Veil!
***Please don't*** post security issues in [the public issue tracker](https://github.com/Veil-Project/veil/issues)
and use the contacts mentioned below instead.

## Responsible Disclosure

For all security related issues, Veil has three main points of contact:

* James Burden, (4x13) https://keybase.io/4x13
* Mimir (mimirmim), https://keybase.io/mimirmim
* Florian Maier (marsmensch), https://keybase.io/marsmensch

Please send all communications to those parties and expect a reply within 72h.

## Scope

The Veil project is committed to the best practices around safe harbor for good-faith
security research outlined at http://disclose.io/. There is nothing considered out-of-scope
for testers and researchers following the rules outlined in this policy.

## Disclosure Policy

Vulnerability details may be shared with third parties after the vulnerability has
been fixed and the program owner has provided permission to disclose or after 90 days
from submission, whichever is sooner.

## Rewards & Recognition

We are currently working on the creation of a formal reward policy. Until this 
policy is available, we will decide on a case to case basis and researchers should 
not expect a specific reward. Veil project is nonetheless grateful for all legitimate 
discoveries of vulnerabilities, and is happy to acknowledge the vulnerability and 
the researchers after a fix has been widely deployed.
